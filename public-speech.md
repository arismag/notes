## How to start a speech

- With a **story** (about you or another person). Similar to a fairy tale.
- With a "**shocking fact**" or a "**big idea**" (you or other people may have).
- With a **question** everyone is interested to.
- With a **joke**, a surprise, an unexpected move or question etc.

## Using your body

- Use your **hands** (gestures) while talking to chop, show, give, prevent/stop.
- Use your **eyes**.
- Palms should be up (show the sky).
- Never point to the audience (using your finger).
- Walking on the room. Move **around the center** not too away from the center, not behind of the decks. Move between the seats.

## Several tips

- It's all about the audience (they should be the center of the speech, not the presenter).
- Tell real stories...
- Demonstrate using things or objects.
- Engage with the audience (eg ask direct questions).
- Change the tone or volume of your voice.
- Use speaking pauses when necessary.
- Use situational awareness (bold, tone, silence, audacity etc).
- Close your speech with the same topic (story, big idea, outcome, call to action etc) you started with.
